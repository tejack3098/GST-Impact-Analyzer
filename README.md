# GST Impact Analyzer: Generating Comparative Invoices for Products

## Project-Based-Learning(PBL), Pillai College of Engineering : Winning Project 

Our project aims to facilitate the understanding of the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on purchased products through the generation of a comprehensive invoice. By using our Java-based application, users can compare the price and tax changes before and after the implementation of GST on the given product.

Implemented using Java Swings, our application provides an intuitive interface for users to add products to their cart and visualize the invoice. We used PostgreSQL database and JDBC connections to ensure the storage and retrieval of relevant data.

Our team conducted extensive research on current GST rates to ensure the accuracy of the tax applied to each product. With our application, users can gain a better understanding of how GST affects their purchases and make informed decisions.

Overall, our project offers a convenient and easy-to-use solution for understanding the impact of GST on products, providing users with valuable information for their financial planning.
